*   **Planned Purchases & Reminders**: A dedicated system to track future acquisitions with swipe-to-buy functionality that automatically converts plans into expense entries.
*   **Security Suite**: Dual-layer protection featuring biometric authentication (FaceID/Fingerprint) and a secure 4-digit passcode fallback.
*   **Visual Analytics**: Real-time spending trend graphs to help identify financial patterns over weekly, monthly, or all-time scales.

## Usage Guide

### Dashboard
The main screen provides a high-level summary of your financial health, displaying Total Income, Total Expenses, and your current Net Balance. From here, you can quickly navigate to specific management modules.

### Managing Finances
*   **Income/Expenses**: Enter the source/item name and amount. Toggle the "Recurring" switch to set a specific day of the month for automated logging.
*   **Planned Purchases**: Track items you intend to buy. When you finally make the purchase, swipe the item in the list to "Mark as Bought," which automatically logs it as an expense and updates your balance.

### Security & Settings
Navigate to the Settings gear on the dashboard to:
*   Enable/Disable Biometric Security.
*   Configure a 4-digit Passcode.
*   Set a **Budget Threshold**. The app will notify you once your total monthly expenses reach this specified limit.
